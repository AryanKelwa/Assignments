    "'w' (Write Mode): It opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file doesn't exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "'a' (Append Mode): It opens the file for appending. The new data being written will be inserted at the end of the file.\n",
    "'r+' (Read and Write Mode): It opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
